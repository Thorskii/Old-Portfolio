      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>As mentioned previously, I have a few hobbies I do on my free-time. One of which is photography. I've been interested in photography pretty much my whole life as I've loved capturing the beautiful elements of life not everyone gets to see. I take great pride in my photography work and I only showcase my absolute favorite. All of the photos on my website are taken and edited by me!</p>
      <p>Another one of my 'less interesting' hobbies is playing video games. Video games, like many others, was my entrance into the world of technology as a child. I had always dreamed of making my own game, with my own story, and with my own mechanics. I've met numerous lifelong friends through gaming and it holds a special place in my heart.</p>
